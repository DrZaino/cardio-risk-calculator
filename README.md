# cardio-risk-calculator
This web-based calculator allows users to compare Kaplan-Meier (KM) and Cumulative Incidence Function (CIF) estimates of cardiac death probabilities using:

Simulated data (n=2500, age 45–65)

NHANES 1999–2010 data (age 45–65)

🔍 Users can select a starting and ending age to interactively visualize how KM overestimates risk compared to CIF.
